# Idead Programming Language
A lot of programming languages have been designed but the key point is missing in manay areas in their designs. 
Lanaguages should be easy for everyone to understand and implement their ideas.

This design is meant to be the kind that is easy to pick-up by beginners and easy to 
code and understand the code in the next time your come back to it without much thinking. 
It just reads  natural. My intension is not to create a new language but use the 
ideas available to create something better.

```d
import std.io;


//Entry Point
void main() {
    int8 number1 = 10;
    int16 number2 = 10;
    int32 number3 = 10;
    int64 number4 = 10;
}



```
